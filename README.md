# Programming-puzzle-solutions

Competitive programming is a great way to learn very rapidly, you get to solve problems which are not that common in day-to-day business needs. It's a personal and intellectual challenge. It's my sudoku if you will. In order to keep track, I decided to push the solutions to challenges I participated to, not to be a spoiler but to give motivation to find better solutions to these interesting problems.

Note, the goal here isn't to write the shortest solution to a problem, but rather to code it in a readable manner using my personal coding style (not my day-to-day business coding style, e.g. there's no semicolons & fewer comments).

All the solutions are in JavaScript, but I may add more languages later.
