# Programming-puzzle-solutions

Competitive programming is a great way to learn very rapidly, you get to solve problems which are not that common in day-to-day business needs. It's a personal and intellectual challenge. It's my sudoku if you will. In order to keep track, I decided to push the solutions to challenges I participated to, not to be a spoiler but to give motivation to find better solutions to these interesting problems.
